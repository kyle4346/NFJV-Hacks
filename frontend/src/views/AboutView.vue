    <h1>Team Mission</h1>
    <p>
      The demand for telehealth has increased drastically because of COVID-19
      2020-2021 Year. With the doctor's recommendation concerning COVID-19, it's
      new variant, and other health issues worldwide, people are hesitant to
      visit hospitals or public places for safety and health reasons. Our team
      goal is to improve accessibility to Telehealth by implementing a device
      specifically for the REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM (RPMS) that will
      monitor the patientâ€™s vitals such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and blood
      pressure. By completing this project, not only will we give better
      alternatives to medical checkups today, but also increase awareness of the
      uses of these medical devices so that they can be designed for personal
      use.
